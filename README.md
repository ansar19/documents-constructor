### Writing templates

For now, there is now online interface to create and update a template,
you have to fork this project and make merge requests.

Templates are markdown files processed and rendered in both Markdown and
HTML.

The documentation about formatting your template, create dynamic blocks 
and use variables is available [online](https://typing-monkey.com/#/help).

To create a template, create a file somewhere in `public/templates` and 
add an entry in `src/templates.json`. You may specify a license, a 
language and some tags.

### Translations

If you want to see the project translated in your language, let's say,
Esperanto, create `src/locales/eo.json` and put the translation strings
in it. Use another translation file as a base.

Edit all the translation files and add your locale in the `locale section`:

```json
  "locales": {
    "en": "English",
    "eo": "Esperanto",
    "fr": "Fran√ßais"
  },
```

To finish, add the entry in the menu: edit `src/components/LocaleSelector.vue`
and add `eo` to the list of supported locales:

```js
  data () {
    return {
      locales: ['en', 'eo', 'fr'],
    }
  },
```
